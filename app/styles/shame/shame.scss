// Shame SCSS decalrations to be refactorized

////TASKBOARD-TABLE.SCSS && TASKBOARD-TABLE.JADE////

//Taskboard table header brokes when added position relative and positionabsolute to its child
// No clearfix or known hack fixes it
// Could be because of flexbox?
// height of the table has been set manually, wich is ugly.
.taskboard-table-header {
    height: 40px;
}
